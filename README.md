Programming Test – Screening Round

This repository contains solutions for the 4 programming problems given in the Tandemloop Full Stack Developer Screening Test.  
All programs are written in Python 3.

I have also used **try–except (try and catch)** in my code to handle unwanted errors (like wrong input type, division by zero, etc.) so the program does not crash.

- `Problem-1.py` → Calculator using class (Add, Sub, Mul, Div)
- `Problem-2.py` → Generate odd numbers series up to `a`
- `Problem-3.py` → Generate odd numbers series with even/odd rules
- `Problem-4.py` → Count multiples of 1–9 in a given list

###How to Run
1. Open a terminal in the project folder.
2. Run any program with:
   ```bash
   python Problem-1.py
